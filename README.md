# Text-compare
Simple python app to compare two .txt files 

Inside folder "Files to compare" you'll see two .txt files: 
 - demo.txt ----> inside this file you should paste text that is in Evidence file or on Corvidae (demo) page
 - scheme.txt --> inside this file you should paste text that you see on the scheme page that you currently testing 
 
After running Compare.py script "Evidence" folder will be created in which you'll see Difference.txt file - this file is containint results of the comparisson. 

IMPORTANT: you can use "demo.txt" and "scheme.txt" files however you please (use it for different projects, or just compare two random texts), but above way is the most clear and easy to use while working on HOP testing.
