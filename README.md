# Text-compare
This is a simple Python app to compare two .txt files 

Inside folder "Files to compare" you'll see two .txt files: 
 - demo.txt ----> inside this file you should paste text that is in Evidence file or on Corvidae (demo) page
 - scheme.txt --> inside this file you should paste text that you see on the scheme page that you currently testing 
 
After running Compare.py script "Evidence" folder will be created in which you'll see Difference.txt file - this file is containint results of the comparisson. 

IMPORTANT NOTE 1: if you want to keep particular Difference.txt file as a evidence or for later use you need to move it into different location or change it's name. If you don't do this script will overwrite existing file next time you'll run it.

IMPORTANT NOTE 2: you can use "demo.txt" and "scheme.txt" files however you please (use it for different projects, or just compare two random texts), but above way is the most clear and easy to use while working on HOP testing.
